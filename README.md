This is a student portfolio designed and coded by Sarp Toprak Birben. 

## Process of Design/Code

I was heavily inspired by [loketdesign's](www.loketdesign.com) colour palette and its minimalistic yet interesting design choices. You can check my design in [embed][http://example.com/file.pdf](https://github.com/toprakbir/portfolio/blob/main/figmadesign.pdf)[/embed]. Some of the elements such as the graphic is not present and this is due to the artistic vision. 

## What's new?

My idea of a portfolio is that; it should be fun to look at and see what the programmer's capabilities are rather than just an empty page with nothing but Resume. I tried to break this traditional way by creating dragable grid on the project section. First I found a library called gridstack and later found out that I could not configure it to my react project; and later I found out that I could do the same task but with another library with react-grid-layout.

## What's upcoming?

I would like to keep the current layout and add as I go to projects and Resume. In the year 2025, my goal is to create breathing rooms in my design and more components to elevate the feel of minimalistic look to my portfolio.
